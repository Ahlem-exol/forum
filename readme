### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Prepare XAMPP Folder:**
   - Place your FMME application in the `htdocs` folder inside your XAMPP directory. For example, if you have a folder named `fmme`, it should be placed in:
     ```
     C:\xampp\htdocs\fmme
     ```

2. **Install Composer (If Not Already Installed):**
   - If you havenâ€™t installed Composer yet, download and install it from [composer.org](https://getcomposer.org/).
   - Ensure that Composer is globally available via the command line.

3. **Run Composer Command to Install PHPMailer:**
   - Open the command line (CMD or PowerShell) and navigate to the FMME directory:
     ```
     cd C:\xampp\htdocs\fmme
     ```
   - Now run the command to install PHPMailer via Composer:
     ```
     composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
     ```
     This will install PHPMailer and update your `composer.json` file.

4. **Open FMME in Your Browser:**
   - After Composer completes the installation, open your browser and go to:
     ```
     http://localhost:1337/fmme
     ```
   - This should open your FMME web application.
